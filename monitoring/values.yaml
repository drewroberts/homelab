# FILE: homelab/monitoring/values.yaml
#
# Default values for the kube-prometheus-stack Helm chart.
# This file provides a centralized, version-controlled configuration for the entire monitoring stack.

# --- Prometheus Operator Configuration ---
# The operator is the core component that manages the other monitoring resources.
prometheus-operator:
  # Allow the operator to watch for ServiceMonitors in any namespace.
  # This is crucial for automatically discovering and scraping metrics from your applications.
  serviceMonitorSelectorNilUsesHelmValues: false

# --- Prometheus Instance Configuration ---
prometheus:
  prometheusSpec:
    # Set the data retention period for metrics.
    retention: 30d
    # Enable persistent storage for the Prometheus StatefulSet.
    storageSpec:
      volumeClaimTemplate:
        spec:
          # This should match the StorageClass created for your NFS provisioner (from Phase B).
          storageClassName: nfs-client
          accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
          resources:
            requests:
              storage: 50Gi

# --- Grafana Instance Configuration ---
grafana:
  # Use a StatefulSet for Grafana and enable persistence.
  persistence:
    enabled: true
    type: pvc
    storageClassName: nfs-client # Use the same NFS provisioner.
    accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
    size: 10Gi
  # Best Practice: Define the admin password via a Kubernetes secret rather than in values.
  adminPassword:
    existingSecret: grafana-credentials
    secretKey: admin-password
  # Configure Ingress to expose Grafana securely.
  ingress:
    enabled: true
    ingressClassName: traefik
    hosts:
      - "monitoring.drewroberts.com"
    tls:

    annotations:
      # Instruct Traefik to use the Let's Encrypt resolver configured in Phase A.

  # Pre-configure the Loki data source.
  # This assumes Loki is running and accessible at this service address.

# --- Alertmanager Configuration ---
